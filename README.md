# Code Compiler (aka "Egg") 

## Overview  
This project is a homemade code compiler that translates a subset the C programming language into assembly language. This was a semester-long project developed over the course of my UW-Madison class: Introduction to Programming Languages and Compilers. We were provided skeleton code and tasked with writing the key methods, utilziing our learning material from the class. This project was developed in partnership with two other classmates. The term "egg" was our class's name for the compiler, a twist on the name "gcc".

NOTE: This is only a subset of the program! This is most of what I could recover from my files, and has not been tested since then. This is merely a code showcase.

## Tools Used
