# Code Compiler (aka "Egg") 

## Overview  
This project is a homemade code compiler that translates designed to translate a subset the C programming language into assembly language. This was a semester-long project developed over the course of my UW-Madison class: Introduction to Programming Languages and Compilers. We were provided skeleton code and tasked with writing the key methods using our learning material from the class.

NOTE: This is only a subset of the program! This was most of what I could recover from my files, and has not been tested since then. This is merely a code showcase.

## Tools Used  
- Java
- Remote linux server for hosting
